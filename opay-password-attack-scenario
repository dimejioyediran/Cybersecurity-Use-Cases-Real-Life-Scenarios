Scenario: Weak Password Policy at a Fintech Company

Background  
A fictional fintech startup, "PayFlex" (inspired by real companies like Opay), had rapid growth and onboarded thousands of users. However, they did not enforce strong password requirements, and users often used simple passwords like "123456" or "password1".

What Went Wrong  
- No minimum password complexity  
- No multi-factor authentication (MFA)  
- No login monitoring or alerts

What Happened  
An attacker used a password spraying technique â€” trying commonly used passwords across thousands of accounts. Within minutes, multiple user accounts were compromised, including one admin-level account.

Impact  
- Unauthorized access to customer data  
- Regulatory issues due to data protection laws  
- Loss of user trust and media backlash

How It Could Have Been Prevented**  
- Enforce strong passwords (minimum length + special characters)  
- Require multi-factor authentication for all users  
- Monitor login behavior for unusual activity  
- Implement rate-limiting and account lockouts  

Lessons Learned  
Cybersecurity basics like password hygiene and MFA are often overlooked, especially in fast-growing companies. But skipping them creates major risks.
