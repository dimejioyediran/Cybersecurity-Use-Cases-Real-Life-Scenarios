# Scenario: Insider Threat in a Tech Startup

**Background**  
A fast-growing tech startup hired a contract developer to work on their internal dashboard. The developer had temporary access to sensitive internal systems and databases.

**What Went Wrong**  
- No access control policies or role-based permissions
- Lack of monitoring for suspicious activity
- No background checks or proper offboarding process

**What Happened**  
The contractor downloaded sensitive client data and sold it on the dark web. The breach was only discovered when clients began reporting identity theft and unusual activity on their accounts.

**Impact**  
- Loss of customer trust  
- Legal action and regulatory penalties  
- Company reputation severely damaged

**How It Could Have Been Prevented**  
- Enforcing the principle of least privilege (only give access needed to do the job)  
- Implementing user activity monitoring and alerts  
- Conducting background checks for contractors and employees  
- Immediately revoking access after contract completion

**Lessons Learned**  
Insider threats arenâ€™t always malicious at first, but unrestricted access and lack of oversight can turn internal users into major risks.
