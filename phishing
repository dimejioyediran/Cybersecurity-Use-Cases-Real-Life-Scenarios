Scenario: Phishing Attack on a New Employee

Background  
A mid-sized logistics company hired a new employee in the finance department. On their first week, the employee received what appeared to be an email from the company’s CEO, requesting an urgent transfer of funds for a supposed business opportunity.

What Went Wrong  
- The email address was slightly misspelled (e.g., ceo@logistixx.com instead of ceo@logistics.com)
- The tone of urgency pressured the employee into skipping proper verification
- No email filtering or phishing awareness training was in place

What Happened 
Believing the request was legitimate, the employee processed the payment of over ₦5,000,000 to the scammer’s account. The fraud was only discovered after the real CEO denied making such a request.

Impact  
- Major financial loss  
- Damage to employee confidence  
- Internal investigation and media attention

How It Could Have Been Prevented  
- Training employees to verify unusual requests, especially those involving money  
- Implementing an internal approval process for financial transactions  
- Using email security tools that flag lookalike domains and phishing attempts  
- Enabling DMARC, DKIM, and SPF email authentication protocols

Lessons Learned  
Phishing emails often exploit urgency and trust. Even tech-savvy employees can fall for them without awareness training and proper verification processes in place.
