# Scenario: Data Theft Over Public Wi-Fi

**Background**  
A marketing executive for a small business accessed company files over free public Wi-Fi at a coffee shop while working remotely. They were not using a VPN or secure connection.

**What Went Wrong**  
- Sensitive company emails and logins were transmitted in plain text  
- No VPN was used to encrypt the internet traffic  
- No endpoint protection to detect suspicious network activity

**What Happened**  
An attacker nearby set up a fake Wi-Fi network named “CoffeeShop Free Wi-Fi” and performed a man-in-the-middle attack. They captured the executive’s email credentials and later accessed the company’s internal files.

**Impact**  
- Breach of confidential company proposals  
- Temporary shutdown of systems to contain damage  
- Loss of client contracts due to data leakage

**How It Could Have Been Prevented**  
- Use of a Virtual Private Network (VPN) on all company devices  
- Training staff to avoid accessing sensitive data on unsecured networks  
- Configuring systems to use HTTPS and email encryption  
- Avoiding auto-connect settings for known networks

**Lessons Learned**  
Public Wi-Fi is convenient, but without protection, it becomes a doorway for cyber attackers. Encryption and employee awareness are crucial safeguards.
